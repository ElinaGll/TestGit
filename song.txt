In my dreams I can be anyone, 

In my dreams I can do anything,

In my dreams I can go anywhere,

In my dreams I can fly to the stars.
As I move through a fantasy land, 

I see castles and dragons,

A fairy takes my hand.

Then a witch in the moonlight suddenly appears! 

But the fairy whispers:

There's nothing to fear.
